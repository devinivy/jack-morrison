### Hi there 👋 &nbsp;I'm Jack

I'm a High-Performance Computing Engineer, which means that I maintain some of the world's most capable computers for use by scientists and engineers of all sorts. 

I've supported projects ranging from COVID-19 studies, to global climate simulation, to teams looking into the origins of the universe, and others that are planning to land humans on Mars.

- 👨‍💻 &nbsp; I’m working on the [Rescale Platform](https://www.rescale.com/) with the goal of [making HPC accessible and easy to use](https://about.rescale.com/rs/285-WFD-495/images/Rescale_Platform_Data_Sheet.pdf).
- 🌱 &nbsp; I spend a lot of time thinking about software portability.
- 💬 &nbsp; Ask me about how to get involved in the HPC community as a student or early-career engineer/developer/researcher.
- 📫 &nbsp; How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackcmorrison/) is best, but if you must, jack@rescale.com works.
- ⚡ &nbsp; Fun fact: I have a small collection of decomissioned supercomputing hardware, including a piece of the [Cray-1 from LLNL (1975)](https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102675086) and a node from [Intrepid](https://www.top500.org/system/176322/), the BG/P system installed at ANL in 2008. If anyone has a Titan node, I'm in the market for one!
